## 🧠 What I Learned

Building this project taught me several important concepts and strengthened my React fundamentals:

# ⚛️ React & Component Structure #

 - Breaking UI into small, reusable components
 - Passing data through props and managing internal component state

# 🔄 useState & useEffect #

 - Fetching API data efficiently
 - Triggering updates when input changes
 - Cleanly handling loading and error states

# 🌐 Working With APIs #

 - Making asynchronous requests using fetch
 - Understanding JSON responses and mapping them to UI
 - Safely handling API keys with environment variables

# 🕒 Timezone Conversions #

 - Converting UNIX timestamps to readable times
 - Adjusting for location-specific timezone offsets
 - Splitting formatted date/time into cleaner UI sections

# 🎨 UI & Styling #

 - Structuring CSS for readability and maintenance

# 🧩 Problem Solving #

 - Breaking down API response data
 - Debugging timezone inconsistencies
 - Improving presentation by splitting date/time into separate lines

This project played a big role in strengthening my understanding of React workflows, async data handling, and UI composition.
